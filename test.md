# White Paper Summary: Artificial Intelligence Governance and Policy\n\nThis white paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance and policy within the USDA Forest Service (USFS). It covers multiple sections and appendices related to risk evaluation, cybersecurity, technical decisions, inventory attributes, RACI, training requirements, references, definitions, and keywords. Additionally, it includes a revision history.\n\nThe executive summary offers an overview of the methods used to develop AI within the USFS and the goals of standardization. The policy section delves into the responsible executives, background, vision, goals, objectives, and scope of the AI Council. The AI Council aims to augment the workforce, utilize historical and business data, optimize business processes, and support fire suppression and wildfire management. The council also strives to define standards, embrace customer-first experience and innovation, ensure data quality and availability, improve efficiency and value, and promote ethical principles and fight bias.\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of conducting inspections on AI engagements against published standards. This helps set expectations with vendors, ensures predictable delivery, eases integration, and maintains AI cognizance. It also underscores the need for increased business and technology alignment to achieve organizational agility. Aligning technology with business goals enables organizations to respond to change more effectively. Additionally, applying software delivery standards reduces the burden on IT and enables consistent and reliable product delivery. The text outlines the structure, membership, and procedures of the Artificial Intelligence Council (AIC), which is responsible for overseeing the development, deployment, and ethical use of AI technologies within the USFS. The AIC includes council leadership, an AI technical lead, council members, and advisors. Subcommittees may be established to focus on specific areas of AI governance. The selection and appointment of council members prioritize expertise, diversity, stakeholder representation, and term limits. The AIC follows regular meetings, agenda setting, and a consensus-based decision-making process.\n\nVarious aspects of AI governance and policy within the USFS are discussed in the text. It mentions the use of voting mechanisms to make decisions, transparency and accountability through documentation, collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, periodic review and evaluation for continuous improvement, and the role of council members and alternates in decision-making. It also discusses the difference between policy and strategy, the responsibility of the OCIO in managing AI engagements, and the importance of data curation and business management. The text further outlines the Keystone AI Bill of Rights policy considerations, including safe and effective systems, algorithmic discrimination protections, data privacy, notice and explanation, and human alternatives. It concludes by mentioning the three types of business processes (management, operational, and supporting) and the importance of process implementation for consistency and risk reduction.\n\nThe text describes the Intelligence Council Engagement Process for AI projects. It outlines the tasks and responsibilities of the AI Council, as well as the steps involved in the initial engagement for a use case. The text also discusses the review process at 50% and 75% completion states, including project status, training dataset review, and risk assessment. It highlights the importance of verifying attribution, resolving dataset findings, and conducting tests for accuracy and safety before operational deployment. The text emphasizes the need to consider fairness, explainability, and nonfunctional requirements throughout the model development life cycle. Finally, it mentions the standards and criteria for conformity to the AI Engagement Process at each stage.\n\nThe text provides information about a risk assessment framework called DREAD (Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) and an impact calculation framework. It also discusses risk bands and categorizes AI engagements based on their risk level (Unacceptable Risk, High Risk, Medium Risk, Low/Limited Risk). The text further mentions the need for cybersecurity measures to protect electronic data from unauthorized use.\n\nLastly, the text includes references, definitions, and explanations related to AI and its various components. It mentions the USDA IT Strategic Plan, the National AI Advisory Committee, AI risk management framework, AI Bill of Rights, and other relevant resources. It defines terms such as agency, artificial intelligence, automation bias, common commercial product, AI Ops, deep learning, explainable AI, foundation model, computer vision, high-investment AI use case, and machine learning.\n\nOverall, this white paper provides a comprehensive overview of AI governance and policy within the USDA Forest Service, covering various aspects, frameworks, processes, and considerations.
